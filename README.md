xkcd

xkcd image downloader together with the alt text. 

You might think "why do this", but in fact this was a Christmas present for my friend, who really likes xkcd. I saved
this pile of jpgs and then with Indesign from Adobe I imported them all using Data Merge. For this function you need csv, 
hence this file.

Hope it will be usefull for someone too.
